The requests are sent through the the route which picks the correct view file.
The view file then communitcates with the controller to pick the corect CRUD
method. The controller uses the model to call methods in the server API to change
the database. If there is an error it will be sent up to the view and it will be
caught and displayed to the user. When the server is loading info the user is shown
a rotating circle that continues until the data is retrieved from the server. If 
the input is successfully handled the user will be sent back to the list screen 
without any errors warning them and the new data will be shown.
